# DivTIESUS
DivTIESUS is a SD/MMC card interface for the ZX Spectrum. First designed by Mario Pratto as DivMMC, DivTIESUS is an independent design, compatible with the I/O ports and mapper used both in DivIDE and DivMMC, but adding more features.

There is a larger version of DivTIESUS, nicknamed "Pijus Magnificus" edition. This one is the "Tiesus del t√≥" version, which I have released for the community, so anyone can build their own interface.
